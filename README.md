## Project Overview
This project focuses on **fine-tuning YOLOv11** for object detection tasks and implementing **MLOps** principles to streamline the model deployment and monitoring process. The goal is to create a scalable and efficient pipeline for training, fine-tuning, and deploying the YOLOv11 model in real-world applications.

### Key Features:
- **YOLOv11 Fine-Tuning**: This project utilizes the YOLOv11 architecture to fine-tune the model on custom datasets for various object detection tasks, ensuring high accuracy and performance.
- **MLOps Integration**: The project incorporates MLOps principles to manage and automate the training, testing, and deployment phases. It includes version control for models, continuous integration, and model monitoring.
- **Automated Workflow**: The system automates the pipeline for training and deploying the model with minimal manual intervention, allowing for easier experimentation and model updates.
- **Model Deployment**: The fine-tuned model is deployed using modern MLOps tools, ensuring quick updates and seamless integration into production environments.

### Technologies Used:
- **YOLOv11** for object detection and fine-tuning.
- **MLflow** for model tracking, experimentation, and version control.
- **Docker** for containerization and ensuring consistency across environments.
- **FastAPI** for creating the inference API for deployment.
- **Grafana** for monitoring
